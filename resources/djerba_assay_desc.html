This assay combines two comprehensive next generation sequencing assays: a DNA-based whole
genome sequencing (WGS) assay and an RNA-based whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) assay.
Whole Genome libraries were prepared using Illumina DNA PCR-Free Tagmentation for fresh-frozen
tumor and normal (typically buffy coat) samples. Whole Genome libraries for FFPE samples were prepared using
NEB Ultra II with FFPE repair (pre-2024) or Watchmaker DNA Library Prep (2024 onwards). 
Only tumor WGS libraries designated as UMI-processed were generated using 
IDT xGen cfDNA and FFPE Library Prep.
Whole transcriptome libraries were prepared from fresh-frozen tissues using the Illumina Ribo-Zero
Plus rRNA Depletion Kit + Illumina cDNA Synthesis and RNA Prep. Whole transcriptome libraries
for FFPE samples were prepared using Illumina RNA Prep with Enrichment.
Paired-end 2x150bp sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 for all libraries with
a target of 100x tumor genome coverage, 40x normal genome coverage, and 100M read-pairs for RNASeq.
Reads were graph-aligned to GRCh38 as the Illumina DRAGEN Multigenome Graph Reference hg38 (alt-masked_graph+cnv+hla+rna_v3)
using the Dragen Complete Suite v4.2.8.
Dragen was used to perform germline (normal) variant calls, somatic variant calls (Small Nucleotide Variants, 
Copy Number Variants, and Structural Variants), Tumor Mutational Burden analysis (using Nirvana functional 
annotations), Microsatellite Instability analysis (using msisensor-pro identified microsatellite sites in 
the provided reference genome), Homologuous Recombination Deficiency analysis (per Myriad methdology), 
Human Leukocyte Antigen type calls (tumor and normal), transcript and gene-level RNA sequence quantification, 
and RNA-based gene fusion detection. GenCode v46 transcript models were used as input to transcript 
quantification, and functional predictions were annotated using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor v113.
Assay results were collated into the report document by OICR's Djerba (1.7.5) using PR2C Tamor Snakemake pipeline.
