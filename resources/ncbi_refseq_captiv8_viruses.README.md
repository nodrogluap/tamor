The Captiv8 system for indicating suitability of checkpoint inhibitor treatment of tumors includes a
scoring element based on evidence of oncogenic viral integration in the tumor DNA sequence. The
list of viruses is enumerated on GitHub in djerba/src/lib/djerba/plugins/captiv8/constants.py as of release 1.8.4,
which cites the source hmftools/virus-interpreter/src/test/resources/virus_interpreter/real_virus_reporting_db.tsv

The Tamor resources/ncbi_refseq_captiv8_viruses.fna file is based on the same TSV source, and includes
all NCBI RefSeq viral genomes with the taxonomy IDs listed in the TSV as of 2025-05-02.
