*NOTA BENE!!! When running snakemake for the first time with this repository, it may take many hours, as it will download both all the software environment needed to run [PCGR](https://sigven.github.io/pcgr/) mutation impact reports, and all the large public resource files needed for the same (by automatically running ``workflow/scripts/download_resources.py``). If you intererupt the downloading and unpacking of these files, you will need to rerun the download script manually.*

# Configuring Tamor to Analyze Your Cancer Cases

Cases are organized into logical units: Projects (a.k.a. cohorts), that have Subjects (a.k.a. patients) that have Samples (e.g. biopsy or blood).  

Cases from the same cohort will be outputted into the same output folder, for organizational purposes.

A Subject must have at least one normal/germline sample. We may expand to support tumor-only analysis in the future.

A Subject can have one or more tumor samples (e.g. primary and refractory).
Each tumor must have a DNA sample, and optionally an RNA sample. 

The default config files are preconfigured for didactic purposes with a public leukaemia genome+transcriptome case from the NCBI Short Read Archive.
This case is part of the cohort ``PR-TEST-CLL``, with the patient labelled as ``PR-TEST-CLL-SAMN08512283``, and there are three sets of input FASTQ files
downloaded/generated by running ``workflow/scripts/download_testdata.py``. The three samples are ``PR-TEST-CLL-SAMN08512283-SRR6702602-T`` (tumor DNA)
, ``PR-TEST-CLL-SAMN08512283-SRR6702602-N`` (pseudonormal DNA generated by the script since no actual normal is available), and 
``PR-TEST-CLL-SAMN08512283-SRR6702601-T`` (tumor RNA). Such long systematic names are not *necessary*, but in practice we have found them very useful as
you start accumulating larger cohorts.

Sequencing instrument run IDs and sample IDs are typically rather opaque and automatically assigned by the sequencing lab. 
These are not part of the config files, nor reported out by Tamor, but rather 
linked to designated Subjects and Samples via the [Illumina Samplesheets](#samplesheets).

## config/config.yaml

``config/config.yaml`` is the file that you can customize for your site-specific settings. 
By default the config is set up to read input files from the ``resources`` folder, and write result files under the ``results`` folder. 
By default the genome index and annotation files, as well as the PCGR data bundle, are expected in ``resources``. 
This is where ``workflow/scripts/download_resources.py`` puts those files.

Tamor's default config has the input lists of paired tumor-normal samples (with minimal metadata, described below) in files called ``config/dna_samples.tsv`` and ``config/rna_samples.tsv``.
These TSVs are the main config files that you will need to edit to run your own samples through the workflow. Config files are internally validated for completeness based on ``workflow/schemas/dna_sample_config.schema.yaml`` and ``workflow/schemas/rna_sample_config.schema.yaml``.

## config/dna_samples.tsv
Has 8 columns to be specified with column names:

```
subjectID<tab>
tumorSampleID<tab>
trueOrFalseTumorHasPCRDuplicates<tab>
germlineSampleID<tab>
trueOrFalseGermlineHasPCRDuplicates<tab>
trueOrFalseGermlineContainsSomeTumor<tab>
oncoTreeCode<tab>
projectID
```

The ``subjectID``, ``tumorSampleID`` and ``germlineSampleID`` must:

- *CONTAIN NO UNDERSCORES*
- The ``subjectID`` must be between 6 and 35 characters (due to a PCGR naming limitation)
- ``tumorSampleID`` and ``germlineSampleID`` must be the exact ``Sample_Name`` values you used in your Illumina sequencing sample spreadsheets (see samplesheet section below for details).

The *third* and *fifth* column tell Dragen whether to consider (in tumor and germline respectively) as PCR duplicates read pairs that map to the same start and end in the reference genome. 
If you used a PCR-free library prep, set this to ``False``, otherwise set it to ``True``.

The *eighth* column is a unique project ID to which the subject belongs. For example if you have two cohorts of lung and breast cancer, 
assigning individuals to two projects would be logical. 
All project output files go into their own output folders, even if they were sequenced together on the same Illumina sequencing runs.

The *sixth* column of the paired input sample TSV file is usually ``False``, unless your germline sample is from a leukaemia or perhaps 
a poor quality histology section from a tumor, in which case use ``True``. This instructs Dragen to consider low frequency variants 
in the germline sample to still show up as somatic variants in the tumor analysis output (see default of 0.05 under ``tumor_in_normal_tolerance_proportion`` in ``config.yaml``)

For the *seventh* column, the type of cancer the tumor represent must be coded. This is preferably an OncoTree code. Those codes can be found here: <https://oncotree.mskcc.org/> 
This information will be used to customize some parts of the variant, gene expression, and immune profiling reports. 
If no cancer type information is available at all, you can use the top-level code in OncoTree: "TISSUE".
While OncoTree codes are preferred, Tamor will also attempt to uniquely map codes from the 
[ICD-O](https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/other-classifications/international-classification-of-diseases-for-oncology), 
[NCIt](https://evsexplore.semantics.cancer.gov/evsexplore/welcome?terminology=ncit), 
[UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/index.html) and 
[HemeOnc](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/HemOnc) systems.

## config/rna_samples.tsv
Has 5 columns to be specified with column names:

```
subjectID<tab>
tumorRNASampleID<tab>
matchedTumorDNASampleID<tab>
projectID<tab>
cohortNameForExpressionAnalysis
```

If you have both normal and tumor RNA samples available, it is critical to list the tumor RNA sample first.  
The first RNA sample listed in the file is the one that will be included on the PCGR report for ``matchedTumorDNASampleID``,
and typically you want to report out regarding the tumor RNA.

The last column ``cohortNameForExpressionAnalysis`` is used for Djerba cohort reporting, e.g. to identify Z-score and percentile 
rank outliers genes in this sample compared to others being processed at the same time and nominally of the same cancer/tissue type as defined by the user.

## Samplesheets
These sample sheets are the only other metadata to which Tamor has access. Place all the 
[Illumina experiment sample sheets](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/sample-sheet-v2-template.html) for your project 
into ``resources/spreadsheets`` by default (see the ``samplesheets_dir`` setting in ``config/config.yaml``). They must be 
called ``runID.csv``, where runID is typically the Illumina folder name in the format ``YYMMDD_machineID_SideFlowCellID``.

*Note that a sample can actually be sequenced across multiple runs, Tamor will aggregate the sequence data across the runs to
generate a single report (e.g. a primary run and some top-up sequencing due to unexpected low read count on the first run). The
same sample name can have the same sample ID or different sample IDs across runs, they will be aggregated regardless. This allows
for a single tumor sample to be prepared using two different sequencing library preps for example.*

If you are providing the FASTQs directly as input to Tamor, they must also be in the ``resources/analysis/primary/sequencerName/runID`` directory, 
with a corresponding Illumina Experiment Manager samplesheet ``resources/spreadsheets/runID.csv``. *Why?* This is required because Tamor reads the sample 
sheet to find the correspondence between Sample_Name and Sample ID for each sequencing library, also analysis for DNA samples differs from that for RNA 
samples, so the sample sheet must also contain a ``Sample_Project`` column. Sample projects with names that contain "RNA" in them will be processed as such, 
all others are assumed to be DNA. The ``Sample_Project`` is not used for any other purpose than distinguishing RNA and DNA, and does not need to be the 
same as the projectIDs listed in the ``config`` folder files.

The samplesheet is also used to determine if Unique Molecular Indices were used to generate the sequencing libraries, which requires different handling in Dragen during genotyping downstream.

*If you provide FASTQ files directly, they must be timestamped later than the corresponding Illumina Experiment Manager spreadsheet, 
otherwise Snakemake will assume you've consequentially changed the spreadsheet and try to automatically regenerated all FASTQs 
for that run -- from potentially non-existent BCLs*.

If you are starting with BCLs, the full Illumina experiment output folders (which contain the 
requisite ``Data/Intensities/Basecalls`` subfolder) are expected by in ``resources/bcls/runID`` (see ``bcl_dir`` setting in``config.yaml``). Tamor will perform BCL 
to FASTQ conversion, with the FASTQ output into ``results/analysis/primary/sequencer/runID`` (see ``analysis_dir`` setting in ``config.yaml``, and the 
default ``sequencer`` is ``HiSeq`` per the test data mentioned earlier).
