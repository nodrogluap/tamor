Reporting of gene expression outliers in PCGR and Djerba relies on large cohorts of public RNASeq data.
Most of these samples are polyA-captured sample preps, ~99% in the case of TCGA according to [Newton et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572424/#:~:text=S21).
Histone mRNAs are not generally polyadenylated, and therefore often artifactually crowd the top of the overexpression outlier reporting when an RNA sample 
submitted to Tamor has been prepared using ribosomal depletion. The ```transcript_id_comparison_blacklist.tsv``` file is intended to remove these artifacts.

To construct it, a list of names for histone genes was downloaded from [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/data/genegroup/#!/group/864)
and used as a filter to [Ensembl BioMART](http://useast.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/757bfbc82cb3828237c45076588cc0ee?VIRTUALSCHEMANAME=default&ATTRIBUTES=hsapiens_gene_ensembl.default.feature_page.ensembl_gene_id|hsapiens_gene_ensembl.default.feature_page.ensembl_gene_id_version|hsapiens_gene_ensembl.default.feature_page.ensembl_transcript_id|hsapiens_gene_ensembl.default.feature_page.ensembl_transcript_id_version|hsapiens_gene_ensembl.default.feature_page.hgnc_symbol&FILTERS=hsapiens_gene_ensembl.default.filters.external_gene_name."H1-0,H1-1,H1-2,H1-3,H1-4,H1-5,H1-6,H1-7,H1-8,H1-9P,H1-10,H1-12P,H2AB1,H2AB2,H2AB3,H2AC1,H2AC2P,H2AC3P,H2AC4,H2AC5P,H2AC6,H2AC7,H2AC8,H2AC9P,H2AC10P,H2AC11,H2AC12,H2AC13,H2AC14,H2AC15,H2AC16,H2AC17,H2AC18,H2AC19,H2AC20,H2AC21,H2AC25,H2AJ,H2AL1MP,H2AL1Q,H2AL3,H2AP,H2AQ1P,H2AX,H2AZ1,H2AZ2,MACROH2A1,MACROH2A2,H2BC1,H2BC2P,H2BC3,H2BC4,H2BC5,H2BC6,H2BC7,H2BC8,H2BC9,H2BC10,H2BC11,H2BC12,H2BC12L,H2BC13,H2BC14,H2BC15,H2BC16P,H2BC17,H2BC18,H2BC19P,H2BC20P,H2BC21,H2BC26,H2BC27P,H2BK1,H2BL1P,H2BN1,H2BW1,H2BW2,H2BW3P,H2BW4P,H3C1,H3C2,H3C3,H3C4,H3C5P,H3C6,H3C7,H3C8,H3C9P,H3C10,H3C11,H3C12,H3C13,H3C14,H3C15,H3Y1,H3Y2,CENPA,H3-3A,H3-3B,H3-4,H3-5,H3-7,H4C1,H4C2,H4C3,H4C4,H4C5,H4C6,H4C7,H4C8,H4C9,H4C10P,H4C11,H4C12,H4C13,H4C14,H4C15,H4C16"&VISIBLEPANEL=resultspanel).
